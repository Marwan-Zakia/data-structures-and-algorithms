write a function called insert shift array that adds a new item in the middle of the array without removing 
any elements of the array

#### Approach & Efficiency
I think my method is one better ways to implement to to mutiple array in a dynamic way the method 

//declare a new array 


// declare a variable that's called half that
takes half of the array 


// declere a variable thats called ceil uses half of the array makes it with no integers 


// do a for loop and an if the itirator equales 
the the ceil then push the item and the array items
