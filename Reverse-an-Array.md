#### Reverse an Array
create a function that accepts an array then reverses it so the first item becomes the last item 

#### Whiteboard Process

#### Approach & Efficiency
//  i declared a new array 
// did a for loop and made the array length -1 so the loop starts from the first item of the array and equalize it with the iterator (i)
// then make the i bigger than -1  so you can start from the last item 
// decrement the loop
// push the results to the new array
